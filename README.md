# WeddingRoom

Hello!

This is a virtual escape room I designed for my wedding to keep people occupied during cocktail hour. It incorporates HTML, CSS, and JS. It was meant to guide users through our venue for some clues and assistance, but I've changed it to be purely online now.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you!
