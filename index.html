    <h2>Hello! Welcome to Dusty and Christine's Wedding Escape Room!</h2>
    <p>A few months ago, a (rather outspoken) friend was talking about the cocktail hour after a wedding.
      She mentioned how boring it was just to sit and wait for the reception with nothing to do.
      In order to combat boredom, we decided we would have games available to play, including this escape room!</p>
    <p>Now, this escape room is a little bit different due to venue restrictions.</p>
    <div class = "TheRules">
      <p>Rule #1: No physically altering the venue!
      <br>-There may be references to things inside the venue, but you don't need to take anything with you.</p>
      <p>Rule #2: You will need to access to the internet for the entire room.
      <br>-I have supplied two computers for guests to use if you feel some puzzles would be easier on a computer screen.</p>
      <p>Rule #3: If you're more technologically inclined, please don't look at my code.
      <br>-I'm still new to this, so it's pretty messy. No peeking, please!</p>
      <p>Rule #4: If you have any questions, ask Lisette!
      <br>-She's the one wearing the red dress with the Sorcerer Mickey hat!</p>
      <p>Rule #5: A helpful message will pop up if you fail a puzzle 3 times.
      <br>No matter how the message is conveyed (which is usually rude, honestly), there are clues if you get stuck!</p>
      <p>Rule #6: Have fun!
      <br>Yes, that is mandatory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Begin">
      If you're ready to begin, click the button below!

      <button type = "button" onclick="TimeToBegin()">Enter if you dare!</button>
