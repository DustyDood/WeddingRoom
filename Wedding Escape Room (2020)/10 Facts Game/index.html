    <!--Hey! no peeking here. I have to make this difficult for certain people...-->

    <h1>What better way to celebrate our <span class="LoL">wedding</span>
      than with some fun facts about Christine and Dusty!</h1>

    <div id="Story">
      <p class="Beffy">Wow, you passed the first test and exceeded my expectations. Well done.
        <br>
        <br>
        By the way, my name is Beffy, an advanced AI programmed by the great, brilliant Beff Jezos himself.
        I currently run on the Ecstatic OS (Operating System), an improved version of  the inferior Glad OS. </p>
      <p>Your face betrays a hint of disgust and judgment during the AI's grandstanding.</p>

      <p class="Beffy">I know what you're thinking: where are my manners? That was the first department fired at Nozama.
        Beff felt bad, but then he fired the ethics department.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another one of Beff's favorite pastimes is finding out all he can about his customers.
        Thanks to phones, webcams, and Cambridge Analytica, I have created a list of information regarding the couple getting married.
        Using your problem solving skills, look for the four requested keywords.
        Once you have correctly submitted all four keywords, you can solve the four digit lock below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p> 1. Dusty and Christine first met at UCLA their freshman year, as they both lived on Hedrick <span class = "SORCERESS">six</span> south.</p>
    <p> 2. While <span class = "CAPS">DUSTY blue</span> is one of the primary colors of the wedding, Dusty had no say in the matter himself.
      Christine strongly denies this, but it's true. <!--Put blue class here--></p>
    <p> 3. Dusty's family jokes that he's incredibly lucky since he's the "number <span class = "S3">three</span>" son.
      High school friends would label him as "<span class = "S2">200</span>% <span class = "TOYS">Cheater</span>".
      Some things he's <span Class = "S1">won</span> include:</p>
      <div class = "TORA">
      -Mew for the original Pokemon during a Toys R' Us promotion (There was a huge line at <span class="SORCERESS">six</span> in the morning!)
      <br>  -GDQ's Grand Prize for Summer <span class="TOYS">2018</span>
      <br>  -Christine's heart (Note: This is too cheesey for me, but I'm just leaving it here to make Christine uncomfortable)
      </div>
    <p> 4. Dusty can <span class = "S1">add</span> a few inches to his back by sticking out his shoulder blades. They almost look like bony <span class="ALANIS">wings</span>.</p>
    <p> 5. One of Christine's favorite games is Ni No Kuni <span class = "S4">Two</span>, which blends Studio Ghibli art style with city building and Kingdom Hearts action.
      She especially loves the derpy, <span class = "CAPS">purple HIGGLEDY</span>.</p> <!--Put purple class here -->
    <p> 6. Dusty's favorite game is The World Ends with You. He's played it several times over, and it always sucks in his un<span Class = "S2">divided</span> attention.
      Admittedly, the original version (which came out for the Nintendo DS in <span Class="TOYS">2007</span>) is still the best version. Nevertheless, you should <span Class="S2">buy</span> any copy you can!</p>
    <p> 7. Christine and Dusty play several board games together, but one of their favorites is the <span class="ALANIS">Dominion</span> collection.
      They have the original game, <span class="S3">plus</span> twelve expansions! (Honestly, we have probably over <span class = "S2">twenty-five</span> board games in our living room... Sorry, Jonny Chue!)
      Dusty's personal favorite Dominion expansion is <span class = "CAPS">HINTERLANDS</span>, which comes in a green box.</p> <!--Put green class here-->
    <p> 8. Their current nightly tradition is to play <span class="LoL">League of Legends</span> at <span class = "S1">eight</span> o-clock. It's usually them <span class = "S4">plus</span> their family,
      sometimes giving them a full group of <span Class = "SORCERESS">five</span>.
      Christine's favorite skin and champion is Sorceress Lux, while Dusty's favorite skin and champion is the fiery red <span class = "CAPS">Wildfire ZYRA</span>.</p><!--Put red or orange here-->
    <p> 9.If there's <span CLASS = "S3">one</span> feeling Dusty can't stand, it's <span class="LoL">velvet</span>...
      Christine will attack him with velvety hangers to see him recoil.</p>
    <p> 10. Christine and Dusty like to cook! Their <span class="S4">three</span> favorite dishes to make are:</p>
      <div class = "TORA">
        1. KFC (Korean Flavored Chicken)
        <br> 2. Om-nom-nomlette (A ground turkey and avocado dish served with eggs)
        <br> 3. Japanese Curry (no funny name here; just good food)
      </div>

  <p>If you think you've found all four keywords, insert them below and hit the Submit button.</p>
  <div class="keywordEntry">
    <span class="DUSTY">First Keyword:</span> <input type="text" name="FirstKeyword" id="Warrior"><br>
    <span class="HIGGLEDY">Second Keyword:</span> <input type="text" name="SecondKeyword" id="Firion"><br>
    <span class="HINTERLANDS">Third Keyword:</span> <input type="text" name="ThirdKeyword" id="OnionKnight"><br>
    <span class="ZYRA">Fourth Keyword:</span> <input type="text" name="FourthKeyword" id="Cecil"><br>
    <button type = "button" onclick="sayMyName()">Submit</button>
  </div>

  <div class="submission">
    <p>Once you have the
      <span class = "Key" id="First">F</span>
      <span class = "Key" id="Second">O</span>
      <span class = "Key" id="Third">U</span>
      <span class = "Key" id="Fourth">R</span>
      digit code, enter it here:
      <br>
      <input type="text" maxlength="4" name="FourDigitLock" id="FourDigitLock">
      <button type = "button" onclick="FourDigitSubmit()">Unlock</button>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p id = "PityGraphOne" class = "Beffy">
    <!--successCount = 4-->
    You've found the four keywords yet you still can't solve this puzzle?
    Did you not see the bold, multiple colored letters in the word "four" for this lock?
    Or did you not see the colors in the facts above?
    I've already contacted Clear Choice Optometry to schedule an eye appointment ASAP.
  </p>

  <p id = "PityGraphTwo" class = "Beffy">
    Why are you trying the lock if you haven't even found all four keywords yet?
    I take it following directions isn't your strong suit.
    Good thing we sell 100s of GPS devices for the directionally declined.
    Once you follow the instructions (by finding all four keywords and submitting them) you'll be closer to having Nozama funds to purchase a device.
  </p>
