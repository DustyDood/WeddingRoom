    <!--Hey! no peeking here. I have to make this difficult for certain people...-->

    <h1>What better way to celebrate our <span class="LoL">wedding</span>
      than with some fun facts about Christine and Dusty!</h1>
    <br>
    <p> 1. We first met at UCLA our freshman year, as we both lived on Hedrick <span class = "SORCERESS">six</span> south!
    <p> 2. While <span class = "CAPS">DUSTY blue</span> is one of the primary colors of the wedding, I had no say in the matter myself.
      It's like the opposite of that <span class="ALANIS">Alanis Morissette</span> song... <!--Put blue class here-->
    <p> 3. My family jokes that I'm incredibly lucky since I'm the "number <span class = "S3">three</span>" son.
      High school friends would label me as "<span class = "S2">200</span>% <span class = "TOYS">Cheater</span>".
      Some things I've <span Class = "S1">won</span> include:
      <div class = "TORA">
      -Mew for the original Pokemon during a Toys R' Us promotion (There was a huge line at <span class="SORCERESS">six</span> in the morning!)
      <br>  -GDQ's Grand Prize for Summer <span class="TOYS">2018</span>
      <br>  -Christine's heart (Note: This is too cheesey for me, but I'm just leaving it here to make Christine uncomfortable)
      </div>
    <p> 4. I can <span class = "S1">add</span> a few inches to my back by sticking out my shoulder blades. They almost look like bony <span class="ALANIS">wings</span>.
    <p> 5. One of Christine's favorite games is Ni No Kuni <span class = "S4">Two</span>, which blends Studio Ghibli art style with city building and Kingdom Hearts action.
      She especially loves the derpy, <span class = "CAPS">purple HIGGLEDY</span>. <!--Put purple class here -->
    <p> 6. My favorite game is The World Ends with You. I've played it several times over, and it always sucks in my un<span Class = "S2">divided</span> attention.
      Admittedly, the original version (which came out for the DS in <span Class="TOYS">2007</span>!) is still the best version. Nevertheless, you should <span Class="S2">buy</span> any copy you can!
    <p> 7. Christine and I play several board games together, but one of our favorites is the <span class="ALANIS">Dominion</span> collection!
      We have the original game, <span class="S3">plus</span> twelve expansions! (Honestly, we have probably over <span class = "S2">twenty-five</span> board games in our living room... Sorry, Jonny Chue!)
      My personal favorite Dominion expansion is <span class = "CAPS">HINTERLANDS</span>, which comes in a green box. <!--Put green class here-->
    <p> 8. Our current nightly tradition is to play <span class="LoL">League of Legends</span> at <span class = "S1">eight</span> o-clock. It's usually us <span class = "S4">plus</span> my family,
      sometimes giving us a full group of <span Class = "SORCERESS">five</span>.
      Christine's favorite skin and champion is Sorceress Lux, while my favorite skin and champion is <span class = "CAPS">Wildfire ZYRA</span>. <!--Put red or orange here-->
    <p> 9.If there's <span CLASS = "S3">one</span> feeling I can't stand, it's <span class="LoL">velvet</span>... For some reason, it makes my skin crawl...
      Christine will attack me with velvety hangers to see me recoil.
    <p> 10. Christine and I like to cook! Our <span class="S4">three</span> favorite dishes we make are:
      <div class = "TORA">
      1. KFC (Korean Flavored Chicken)
      <br> 2. Om-nom-nomlette
      <br> 3. Japanese Curry (no funny name here; just good food)
      </div>
