    <h3>The events you are about to read are based on a true story.</h3>
    <h6>In other words, it's mostly false.</h6>
    <div id = "Story">
    Our story begins with Beff Jezos, a man with an extraordinary amount of wealth. Beff hit it big in life, making the great company we know today as Nozama.
    As the old saying goes, "With great wealth comes great eccentrity." This is especially true for Mr. Jezos;
    today, and today only, Beff is giving away money to his company Nozama.
    In order to acquire the money, you must learn more about Beff and solve some of his favorite puzzles. Yet, there is a catch:
    you only have 30 minutes before the website closes and locks you out.

    <p>Do you have what it takes to win Beff Jezos's money?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I'll take that as a yes.





    <p>Growing up, Jeff was never good with addresses... Try as he might, he always had trouble combining numbers with words.
      <span id="JezosWhine">"Why can't I just use a 7 character alphanumeric code??"</span> the precocious Beff cried. Ever since that day, Beff vowed to never use a typical address ever again.
      Instead, he looked into other methods of recording his address, never letting go of his childhood scar.
      Today, Nozama's first headquarters building, the Doppler building, lies at <span id="Doppler">JM86+2J Seattle, Washington</span>.
      <br>

    <p>They say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. The first puzzle is to submit your current location
      (University Club UCI Irvine at 801 E Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA 92697) in Mr. Jezos' preferred 7 character alphanumeric form.
      While this initial task may be daunting, the internet is your friend.
      <br>Specifically,
      <span class="Yell">Google Maps</span> is a <span class="Yell">plus</span>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="./PlusCodeSymbol.png" alt="The Plus Code Symbol" style="width:65px;height:50px;">

    <p>If you think you have the right answer, type it into box below and hit submit.

    <div id = "SubmitArea">
      <input type="text" maxlength = "7" name="PlusCodeAddress" id="submittedAnswer"> Irvine, CA
    </div>
    <button type = "button" onclick="AddressSubmit()">Submit</button>


    <script>
      var pityCount = 0;
      function AddressSubmit() {
        var answer = document.getElementById("submittedAnswer").value;
        answer = answer.replace(/\s+/g, '');
        //alert(answer);
        if (answer.toUpperCase() == "J5V4+5X") {
          alert("Congrats!");
          window.open("../Franchise Game/index.html")
        }
        else
        {
          pityCount++;
          alert("I'm sorry, but that is incorrect...");
          //alert(pityCount);
          if (pityCount >= 3) {
            alert("You know, GOOGLE MAPS and PLUS being in larger font are a hint... It's almost like they're some kind of CODE.")
          }
        }
