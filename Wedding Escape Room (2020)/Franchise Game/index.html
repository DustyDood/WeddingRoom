      <p>With a startling, mechanical whir, the device in front of you behaves as if possesed.
        Soon, an unfamiliar voice rings out...</p>
      <p class="Beffy">GREETINGS, STRANGER.</p>
      <p>You look down to your device and realize that something (or someone?) is speaking to you!</p>
      <p class="Beffy">YOU HAVE PASSED THE FIRST TEST BY SUBMITTING YOUR ADDRESS. OF COURSE, WE ALREADY KNEW. WE AT NOZAMA KNOW EVERYTHING.</p>
      <p>Slightly uncomfortable yet intrigued, you continue to listen.</p>
      <p class="Beffy">TO FURTHER PROGRESS, WE HAVE ANALYZED YOUR LOCATION AND CREATED A RELEVANT PUZZLE. IT'S SO SIMPLE, A CHILD CAN DO IT.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the screen before you, four (hopefully familiar) symbols slowly take shape.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="Beffy">BEFORE YOU ARE FOUR SYMBOLS RELATING TO BEFF'S FAVORITE FRANCHISES. ON THIS WEBSITE IS A 4 DIGIT LOCK.
        BY ANALYZING YOUR VENUE, ENTER THE FOUR RELEVANT DIGITS TO PROCEED.</p>
      <p>Confused, you decide to follow the voice's advice and look around, hoping to discover some clue.</p>

      <div id="SubmitArea">
        <p>Once you believe you have found the four relevant digits, enter them below.</p>
